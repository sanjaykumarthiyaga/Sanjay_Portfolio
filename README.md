Projects of data analysis
# [Project 1 : Breast cancer analysis]( https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Breast-Cancer-Analysis )
      •	 Classifying the breast cancer type: Malignant and Benign using real-valued features such as radius, texture, perimeter.
      •	 The datas are normalised and than algorithm such as KNN , fishers LDA , liner discriminant analysis are applied to find the accuracy.
      •	 On the same dataset the PCA is applied by creating correlation matrix by using the found eigen values and eigen vectors
      •	 Atlast the same accuracy this dataset is also forund and compared with the normal datasets accuracy.
# [Project 2: Data analysis of stat19 road accident](https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Data-analysis-for-stats19-road-accident-)
      •The data set are from are stats19 road accident by casualty is used to answer the questions
      • EDA is done on the dataset to make the data structured to answer the questions.
      •The severity of accident based on vehicle was found by using relevant dataset from the database
      •A linear regression is done on the current data to forecast the future count of accidents 
# [Project 3: Data modelling for Covid19](https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Data-modelling-of-COVID19-)
      •Basic data exploration is done and wave analysis for all the countries are defined using straight line and median filter technique. Further analysis is done by implementing exponential grows and logistic growth.
     •A generalized SIR model (S-susceptible, I-Infected, R-Recovered) is modelled with the observed cumulative cases for all the countries.
     •Consideration of psychological factors in the human beings are included to the traditional SIR model.
     •The combination of a dynamic SIR-type model with the classical triad of stages of the general adaptation syndrome, alarm-resistance-exhaustion, makes it possible to describe with high accuracy the available statistical data for the three countries (India, United Kingdom, and the United States of America). 

# [Project 4 : Exploratory data analysis on PUBG](https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Exploratory-data-analysis)
      •	 A strategy is created to improve mid-level players ranking and K/D by doing a exploratory data analysis based on top players fighting position and their usage of guns.
      •	 Firts of all the top players usage of gun and top fighting positions are maped .
      •	 The gun choosen by the top players and the general gun performance is compared to find out the best gun for the players.
      •	 The peak positions of the top players are found using a heat map .
      •	 Based on the insights useful strategy has been built for mid level players to compete with the top  players.
# [Project 5: TCO calculation for an organisation](https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Total-Cost-expenditure-)
      • Given three organisation A, B and C along with their expnediture data the capex and opex for the organisations are found for 5 years.
      • Using the Capex and Opex for five years , it is than calculated for the next 20 years.
      • Along with the Capex and Opex , the Total cost expenditure of the three organisation are found. 
      • Atlast the organisation with the minimum Total cost expenditure is found.
# [Project 6: EMI calculator](https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Total-Cost-expenditure-)
      • An EMI calculator for a Bank is created.
      • Using the user input i.e interest rate , years , principal amount , the EMI per month is calculated
      • The calculated monthly payment is displayed in a table to make it easy understandabale
     
# [Project 7: IPL Dashboard](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=C4E750CC99925501!1390&ithint=file%2cxlsx&authkey=!AGJ6oHuU8vdQfl4)
      • An dashboard for entire 12 years of IPL is created.
      • Using the dashboard you can see the different trends of players and teams.
      • And also information like top run scorer, highest score , most wickets can be seem visually with necessary graphical represantation.
