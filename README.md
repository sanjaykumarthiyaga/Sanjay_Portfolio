Projects of data analysis
# [Project 1 : Exploratory data analysis on PUBG](https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Exploratory-data-analysis)
      •	 A strategy is created to improve mid-level players ranking and K/D by doing a exploratory data analysis based on top players fighting position and their usage of guns.
      •	 Firts of all the top players usage of gun and top fighting positions are maped .
      •	 The gun choosen by the top players and the general gun performance is compared to find out the best gun for the players.
      •	 The peak positions of the top players are found using a heat map .
      •	 Based on the insights useful strategy has been built for mid level players to compete with the top  players.
      
# [Project 2 : Breast cancer analysis]( https://github.com/sanjaykumarthiyaga/Breast-Cancer-Analysis )
      •	 Classifying the breast cancer type: Malignant and Benign using real-valued features such as radius, texture, perimeter.
      •	 The datas are normalised and than algorithm such as KNN , fishers LDA , liner discriminant analysis are applied to find the accuracy.
      •	 On the same dataset the PCA is applied by creating correlation matrix by using the found eigen values and eigen vectors
      •	 Atlast the same accuracy this dataset is also forund and compared with the normal datasets accuracy.
# [Project 3: TCO calculation for an organisation](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:b1930f3f-5391-4fed-a254-5e953730e3f4)
      • Given three organisation A, B and C along with their expnediture data the capex and opex for the organisations are found for 5 years.
      • Using the Capex and Opex for five years , it is than calculated for the next 20 years.
      • Along with the Capex and Opex , the Total cost expenditure of the three organisation are found. 
      • Atlast the organisation with the minimum Total cost expenditure is found.
